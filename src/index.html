                <h2>Welcome to Burger Radio</h2>
                <p>This is where I would describe the restaurant if it were real, but unfortunately this restaurant is made up entirely out of imagination and does not exist nor take any ownership for any of the burgers/foods that are depicted. So far, the launch of this mythical restaurant has been stellar! We've had some out of our famous celebrities like Boruto Uzumaki, Monkey D. Luffy, and Franky in our doors! Our burgers are made with the finest ingredients, smashed and seared to perfection and topped with your choice of our 55 sauces!</p>
